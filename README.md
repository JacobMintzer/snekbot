# snekbot2
Snekbot2 is a fairly simple discord bot written in Python.

If you want snekbot in your server without messing with any code, click <a href="https://goo.gl/xqfKWn"> here.</a>

If you want to run this, you are going to want to install <a href="https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py">discord.py</a> and have a text file named key.txt in the same directory as snekbot.py
I ran into some issues with the server so I will likely not be updating this anymore
